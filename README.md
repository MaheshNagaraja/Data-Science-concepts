## Pandas vs SQL

Pandas and SQL are distinctly used across industries. Both have their own strengths and purposes.

__SQL__ - Querying and Managing relational database.  
__Pandas__ - Data manupilation and analysis in python.

Here are key points of both SQL and Pandas:  
__1)__ __Data storage__ :  
Pandas work with data load into memory (RMA).  
SQL data is stored in a database, which can handle much larger datasets compared to Pandas. SQL queries operate on this stored data without needing to load it all into memory at once.

__2__ __Querying and Speed__ :
SQL and Pandas can perform operation like filtering, sorting, joining tables, and performing aggregations and grouping operations. But SQL is more optimized compared to pandas when it comes to large datasets.  
*Speed* : Pandas is suitable for small to medium datasets. Operations on large datasets can become slower as data grows beyond memory.
        SQL databases are highly optimized for querying large datasets.
